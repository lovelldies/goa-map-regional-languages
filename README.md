# A map of Goa in regional language scripts

This project sparked out of an idea by [u/Gloomy_Hawk](https://www.reddit.com/user/Gloomy_Hawk/) from this [Reddit post on r/Goa](https://www.reddit.com/r/Goa/comments/n3zjgl/konkani_map_of_goa/).

The plan is to provide a map of Goa with location names in regional language scripts to help people pronounce the names correctly.
